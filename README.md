# 13XLabs GPT-2

## Introduce GPT-2, GPT-NEO, GPT-NEO-X
GPT-2, GPT-Neo, and GPT-Neo-X are three of the largest natural language processing (NLP) deep learning models in the world. Here is an introduction to each of these models:

- GPT-2: Developed by OpenAI in 2019, GPT-2 is an NLP model with 1.5 billion parameters. GPT-2 has the remarkable ability to generate automatic text, allowing it to be used in many applications, including machine translation, sentiment analysis, and text classification.

- GPT-Neo: Developed by the EleutherAI community in 2021, GPT-Neo is an independent NLP model with 1.3 billion parameters. Trained on diverse datasets, GPT-Neo can process natural language with high complexity and accuracy.

- GPT-Neo-X: Released in late 2021, GPT-Neo-X is an advanced version of GPT-Neo, developed by EleutherAI with 2.7 billion parameters. One of the largest NLP models in the world, GPT-Neo-X is designed to run on multiple tasks simultaneously.

All of these models are significant achievements in the field of NLP, providing significant advancements in processing and understanding natural language. They can be used in a variety of applications, from chatbots and machine translation to content creation and machine reading comprehension.

## Native Installation

All steps can optionally be done in a virtual environment using tools such as `virtualenv` or `conda`.

Install tensorflow (with GPU support, if you have a GPU and want everything to run faster)
```
pip3 install tensorflow
```
or
```
pip3 install tensorflow-gpu
```

Install other python packages:
```
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```
