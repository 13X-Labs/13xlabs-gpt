After last year's build I thought it would be great if anyone could add an extra piece that would be much more affordable. Here is an example of how it would work.\n\nThe next year I was able to get both the G-X model and the GTX 830M, with both of them just coming out from the factory with the first release out in May. I'm really happy with the build but with a number of other factors that I was worried about. I've talked about the G-X 2.0 and the GTX 850M as options that aren't quite where they should be, so I'm really curious to see what happens next year.\n\nMy final point is that my wife and I are getting ready to try out the G-X in early May. With that being said, a couple of months ago my girlfriend and I went shopping for the G-X 2.0 at an in-store store. I couldn't resist asking for something as simple as the G-X 2.0 over at Ebay for the best price so I got a coupon from another seller for two G-X 2.0s. Not something I'd look at here with any of the other prices, though, so I've opted the GX 2.0 and bought a new set now.\n\nI am on track to have the G-X 2.0 in a very high quality build as soon as I get it, so if you'd like to help with any project or something else, get in touch with us as well.", "length": 354, "ended": true}

{"id": 4, "text": "\nWhen I first started to write this piece, I wanted to say something about the importance of not just a good way of describing the life of a writer or writer-in-training but also a well-documented and well-researched example about the things a writer or a writer-in-training often say. I am not going to cover such examples, but I want to show that many writing groups and societies are often so much more complex than that. This is a post about how I can change the paradigm in ways that might benefit each other, for that's what makes them so much better (though there are some still a great deal of ways I can change one another)\n\nFirst, the basic principles for what you might call a \"Writers-In-Training Method\".\n\nWhat is a Writer-In-Training?\n\nSo let's get really into the weeds. It's what is often said about the \"Writers-In-Training\" that one's reading, and more often than not, getting those same experiences for you does not just happen by watching you do it, but being a part of it too. This is called \"Writers-In-Training\".\n\nThe idea is similar to the one mentioned elsewhere, however, the goal is to be as much of a part of it as possible. You might consider yourself an \"unemployed writer\" or even work less than a day or two at most. Even if you're not, it certainly would make sense to have someone as a part of your writing training. (I mean, how do we find ourselves in those situations when all of our lives are about something else?)\n\nOnce you become a writer, you will have the skills to be in that class, and you will be able to learn new skills as you work harder. This is also about being aware of the difference between yourself and others in a situation, a \"Writer-In-Training\". This can include things you would never say to your friend or to friends, like \"We can't handle the idea of doing this!\" or \"I'll never read your book again\".\n\nThe concept of an \"unemployed\" Writer-In-Training begins with the word \"unemployed\", which starts with \"work,\" and it includes work for you. It also includes people you might call \"super-professional\" to use if you've got a lot of work to do, so they have experience working there.\n\nThe fact that you get a \"writing training\" like this isn't surprising, and it explains some of what is commonly assumed to be \"unemployment\". What is \"unemployment\"? According to some people, it is the fact that you are an unpaid \"worker who has no real income (or at least can't afford to keep going), who is working all night with no pay for days or nights or months.\" This means you are not going to be able to put in good (to you), productive work or get paid attention to details that other people are not able to get paid attention to, including things like what time each work week, or who does the actual typing, and so forth.\n\nWhy do I Say That?\n\nThis idea that you are an unpaid \"worker who has no real income (or at least can't afford to keep going)\" is actually an old myth. In most people's perspective, the only reason they do that is to be paid for it. We all know that there are people to whom that's a very important concept, but some people don't know this. I try to explain it to my people and tell them it's important to them and that it matters not at all to them, but rather to the rest of us. I'm not saying that they don't get paid for it, or that they don't appreciate the potential value of that, but I think the idea might be a little unfair to them in that situation.\n\nFor them, \"unemployment\" means that there are only a couple of people who are really really good at what they do. Those are people, often those of us in the workforce, who are actually the people who will be a lot of the time, and who will work really hard for you.\n\nIf you have to pick the person who are really good at something, and not just on your own, then you are really good at what you do. That would be a lot harder than it sounds if we had been paid to make those choices. Some people even go so far as to think that they are really well aware of how good working for us really is, and therefore they are just more deserving of that.\n\nSo, I would say that even though you might be able to \"find yourself in those situations when all of our lives are about something else,\" and get paid to do the things you get paid to do, if you do those things, you will still work really hard for a lot of the time (not as much as an unpaid", "length": 1024, "ended": false}
{"id": 5, "text": "I always hate when people tell a story about a character or a scene that would never be told until the last minute. In all my comics, I've always loved seeing characters that people could have seen in their hearts, even when they were not in the game at the time. I've never experienced the same kind of passion for the character they were meant to be for.\n\nI know it's funny when people say, \"I think this will be the only time I'll see all twelve of those characters again.\" I can remember hearing stories like that for years, and they always came from my writing room, even with comics that never made it to print.\n\nEven if one of your comic books didn't make it and everyone is like, \"Oh, you're right. A lot of people haven't made it!\"\n\nOhhhhhhh! Yeah, it's really hard to make an effort to keep track of all the great work you've accomplished. I never put them on the cover of my comic books because that would break them in half. And I don't want people to know: I have only done three or four of these characters that have never made it out of the print version.\n\nWhen you first saw my story, I'm not sure I even heard my name spelled or read it. But I got all of the notes about it and I had the impression I would become a writer for years, and I had a vision for myself. It became very clear when I read it that this was my story. It wasn't an RPG, or a sci-fi one, or anything like that. It was just fun to write, even if some of the characters wouldn't fit in at all, because there's no one person that I have to make my own story around.\n\nAnd then you look at the story's art! What came out of it, I can't remember! Did it look great on paper?\n\nIt wasn't!\n\nNo, I couldn't. My first thing was to just make it really fun. It was like, \"Man, it looks great! So let's put it on it, let's make it really nice.\"\n\nAnd you put it through a big, big, big editing process and then you get this amazing picture of a guy sitting on a couch watching a movie. Why is that? Is it just like, \"Man, don't forget that in this comic book, somebody gets shot,\" or am I just using the right person so it's not even funny? It just becomes so good that you lose interest, just to see that, all the time.\n\nSo I wrote on the back of the pages. When you get your first page, you write a whole page!\n\nYeah! Yeah! You write a whole page.\n\nYou can keep doing that?\n\nRight. You don't have to. That's what I'm doing. Yeah! I want everybody to have that opportunity. Right?\n\nI'm doing the whole thing. I think I did it in 2 days!\n\nRight. I got two months of work to do. I'm just putting it on the cover and doing it. The thing that bothers me is there's this guy who actually lives next door to me on the couch. When they see, you know, this guy, he just goes, \"That guy's so cute!\" And they're like, \"What is it with that? I'm just jealous of that guy and will hate him!\"\n\nHe's kind of like, \"If this guy isn't going to do what he does, we're happy for him. I'd like him to just do what he does.\" I don't want him to be a writer, okay?\n\nI just like to write to people that don't know me. For one person, all that he can do is try to make them feel safe, like, \"Yeah, you're so cool. That was awesome.\"\n\nIn terms of art, I think I'm using a lot of color, but I think I've learned a lot as a writer of color so I don't have to work with colors I don't like.\n\nYeah, because I'm a colorist, we do it in this universe in which I see everyone as colorists.\n\nYeah\u2026\n\nYeah, because it's different. It's just that it's so cool and not like a huge amount of colors. It's just so fun to read. I love that you call it a \"game.\"\n\nWhat's a game? Are any of those words ever really necessary to make you feel special?\n\nWell, I didn't have color to begin with. That is, I had to write for a really, really long time. Before I started this company, I got my first job, so when I started making comics for Marvel I didn't know what color I wanted to work for, and I was reading up on color", "length": 1024, "ended": false}

{"id": 7, "text": "It's a common question in gaming \u2013 and whether or not there's a link to the game-changing game-changing game to bring it to life is always hard to pin down. But as in so many aspects of development, it's worth revisiting \u2013 in a more casual and casual setting.\n\nLet's first dive into the basic steps involved in creating a game and then dive a little more into the game's gameplay. The game will be a story-driven adventure game, with five player teams consisting of one player, one main character, one boss, and one main character as the protagonists.\n\nIn a nutshell, the following are the basic steps in creating a game:\n\nCreate a group of 4 or fewer players with an equal starting stat. (To see a team with a different starting total, compare this to a team with two or more players, see Team 3.)\n\nStart with a main character (as well as several secondary character) and add one character each for each character on the group (or group as a whole). Each player on each main group at half-life will have a different character (the player with the character who gets to kill the main character). The primary character must have a number of different powers, traits, and abilities in order for this character to take the role of hero. The rest will play like the other members and take their place in the team. Each player's primary character must have a character number equal to one over a specified period of time.\n\nCreate a storyboard consisting of: \"Anatomy of a Storyboard\". For each storyboard, players will have at most one character. These characters will share all of two main characteristics and abilities:\n\nThey all can play in turn.\n\nThey all can be summoned at any time by a character (if they're at the same level as you). There are 5 main character types:\n\n- Any type-\n\n- No type-\n\n- None-\n\n- All-\n\nThe main character will get access to and control a group of heroes (which, if all other players want, should be all characters), or a random group of superheroes. Each team with a different hero group can have up to one main character, and up to five secondary characters can have in their team. There are also different powers, attributes, and powers- of which there are many, many of which can change from the players' starting or secondary character type. You can play as the main character here by creating an equal to or equal to one over a certain period of time.\n\nIn order to control your hero, you have to have at least one team captain and at least one team leader (if you're a team that has only one Captain, you have to keep at least one person on each team and one player on each team member). You can have all five Captain in a specific team, but only two should be on each team.\n\nWhen all five Captain have been placed in a team, the character you have won as hero (who has joined your team) will have access to his powers, abilities, and powers. If you've played with a hero (see Hero Powers) for this reason, the character you have is the one who will have access to your abilities (this is called a team member). That person can have in his team any character on it, or can have all the characters on their team, but not have the character on their starting team, but only one in each team. After each team has got one or more, the Captain will come back into playing form and will come on the team (or team as a whole). As often as possible, if he's not on the starting team, he will be on the team. It's also important to note that Captain has access to abilities, but not to the character who wins as hero. The player who joins the team gets in charge of controlling the hero.\n\nIn addition, the number of characters on your team (and therefore your team's hero) has no effect on the number of possible heroes that can be on the team, but can also affect the number of possible heroes on the team. The two players on each team (or team as a whole) get to decide how best to create the game so you can play in team form, and only one of them is available on your team.\n\nIt's an important point! If you had your character in team form you probably would not be able to get anywhere close to the level of the character in player form that you were playing in team form. As such, you might end up losing too much (especially if you are your opponent's team or a group of other players). That's usually the case when you're playing in a multiplayer game, so it helps to know the importance of not running out of team and your ability to control your character within the game's rules and rulesets.\n\nOnce you've got enough of these three character types together", "length": 1024, "ended": false}

How do you pay shipping and handling fees?\n\nIf you choose to deliver satellites with your own private aircraft to locations outside the United States, you will pay a monthly fee.\n\n3.3.1 How do you arrange to pay shipping and handling fees?\n\nWhen a satellite ship from the USA delivers, we provide a list of the costs associated with paying shipping and handling fees.\n\n3.3.2 What are the requirements for paying shipping and handling?\n\nIf you choose to carry out mission or operation requirements related to satellite delivery, you will need to pay for shipping and handling if you have a private aircraft. However, most commercial commercial aircraft are equipped with an aircraft management and navigation system capable of managing the aircraft' cargo as the plane makes its departure from a selected location.\n\nIf you choose to transport a satellite with its own private aircraft to a location outside the U.S., you will need a government ship to transport the satellite, as long as there is sufficient space at the destination.\n\nIf you provide your own private aircraft with an aircraft management and navigation system and other services to make sure that the satellites are delivered safely, you cannot be ordered to take such a voyage.", "length": 1024, "ended": false}

{"id": 14, "text": "\nHERE is a man who died on a railway train in North London. This is not what happened to him. He had stopped to rest on the ground and was suddenly taken aback to see that the man was dead before they knew it. He was sitting on a railway platform. He was sitting in his room, on a railway line, while his brother was sitting on the train. A train passed by, and the man looked down to find him dead in the street.\n\nHis sister was carrying him. He had fallen so the train would not pass him with him. He had not turned his face to the side; his face was so far away that his eyes were barely open. He had only a black and white reflection on himself, while his brother was covered in blood, and the two men had not shown their faces in the past and then suddenly changed into the white bloodstained face of a man who had just died in front of them with the same reflection on him. And I can tell you, he could not have looked at their face and thought they were dead in front of them.\n\nI also hear it said, the man that started the train, and the driver, before he knew what had happened, rushed the train towards the train station.\n\nPeople have always suspected that the man that tried to stop the train at the railway station was the man who had shot the man, and I understand that. This man never tried to look at the men. But the man had tried, and was killed. The man was the only person who could have stopped the train at the station. But by trying to see if the man was dead before the train got to him, he was killed by his brother's bullet.\n\nI repeat that my brother, who was injured, was killed not by his brother but by the driver. He has lost all his strength, so he was killed too. He was injured too. But the person could have saved his brother like a good brother saved his life. His life has been lost because he had been injured, and I can understand that.\n\nI also heard that the man was killed by a bullet. There is no reason why he would have been shot more than once by the train, but this does not seem to have affected him too much. I know that he was so far away, so far away, where nobody expected him to get there and then die. People may not have expected to see him and see him come to this station, but they must also have known that he was so far away that they only found his body in the street with what appeared to be a long, sharp wound to his head.\n\nI cannot imagine how many people might have thought he was dead in front of the station. Some might have just felt that the two men who ran the train into the station had died there in front of him, and then realised that they were dead there too.\n\nI will try and explain how it came to pass. The first thing I say is that a bullet does not hurt people if its bullet passes through skin. I am no expert on bullet impacts, but I suspect that when it goes through skin, it's a very small matter, because one is not going to get much of a chance of hitting it with a bullet. So a bullet goes through a very small part of a person's body in about half a second.\n\nIn the last couple of centuries, a great number of people have died in bullet hit-ins in the UK where bullets are not allowed, because the law allows for bullet strikes if the person is not injured or if he is wounded. My question is: which is better, bullet strike or bullet strike? I suspect the bullet strike is better, the bullet strike is better, the bullet strike is better.\n\nLet it also be understood that the bullet strike is the second most popular projectile in the world. You can look at any one of them. The people running the train have the bullet strike in each hand, which are not the same projectile, because a bullet strikes and you cannot see it, especially in bullet hits. I think that it is also more common in military combat to take a single bullet out of a bullet when firing, where bullets are fired at two people. That will make it a very difficult projectile to hit.\n\nAnd we will not forget that we should not expect all the bullets that are hit. We should not make the assumption in order to get the first round. This is not the case. The next bullets are much more likely to damage. Therefore, the bullet strike is superior for it is more accurate, for its more rapid, for its more deadly. We can expect the next round to hit about the same speed. If it was not a very long bullet, the bullet wouldn't hit him.\n\nIt is one thing to go round the train; not to go round round. It is quite another thing to go round round. But in a military situation and against a military adversary,", "length": 1024, "ended": false}

{"id": 17, "text": ".\n\nThis is a rush transcript. Copy may not be in its final form.\n\nAMY GOODMAN: So let's start by talking about Donald Trump, the president of the United States. He was the first president to enter the White House from behind closed doors, and he's now coming out with a new book, in honor of the 50th anniversary of his inauguration, called The Art of the Deal. And this is Democracy Now! With David Nakamura, we're going to go back to our hosts last night here at The Atlantic University. David Nakamura, welcome.\n\nDAVID NAKAYAMA: It was my honor and privilege to take part in the 70th anniversary celebration of our nation's first black president, Bill Johnson, who was known for his bold, bold policies, which he advocated in every possible way, not only among his black peers, but the American people with whom he served, to see the country from a position of strength. He was president after president, and he was not only a fierce champion, but a man of bold ideas, bold words, and bold words of his own, because in his second inaugural in Washington, he was the first president since William Howard Taft to do so in a black President. And that's why, in the wake of the civil rights movement and the struggles facing the working class, he became one of the country's most bold and fearless leaders in this country.\n\nWhat we're going to talk about today is the power of history, our very existence and the very nature and significance of his legacy. This is history we're beginning to know. It was shaped by a man who was always bold, that was always fierce. These are people our country needs in office in this country. And, as a result, he turned an opportunity to change history in a way that the American people might never have imagined.\n\nAMY GOODMAN: Talk about that. We're going to call him Donald Trump in the name of this country. Donald Trump.\n\nDAVID NAKAYAMA: Yeah.\n\nAMY GOODMAN: So, what do you think of the book?\n\nDAVID NAKAYAMA: We talked about the story of Trump's first inaugural and the story of the United States of America, where he was an outsider, he was a visionary, he was the only candidate to win. You can read it right now at democracynow.org, and we'll continue to discuss what it is, we hope in coming weeks, that will give you a better feel about what's to come, what is the story.\n\nSo, you know how we first met him. We met him in our living room, and we spent a lot of time together, you know, talking about what the book is about. It turns out, as far as what Donald Trump is, for sure, it was\u2014it was a lot more of how he dealt with the issues in his life. He started off in the White House as being more confrontational, more aggressive, much more violent, he kept doing things that he wasn't saying and he was more, you know, an outsider. So, for him, what that is important to understand with people like President Obama and President George W. Bush, who have done more radical policies than Trump was before the Vietnam War ended, is that this is who they are, their people. And it was a man who, they were trying hard, they were fighting hard to come to an agreement, and there was nothing that seemed to be keeping them apart. They had to fight, you know, to keep going, and they did. And what they were fighting for, they were going to fight to get the other side's jobs.\n\nSo, that doesn't necessarily mean we don't have our own leaders in this country. What we have to understand is that Donald Trump was a leader not just on the stump, but also in the community, from his college days. He knew where things worked, that he'd gotten through bad things, he'd gotten through the challenges of life in general. And then he turned his attention to what was going to be, you know, real and lasting change. And Donald Trump showed that the change is possible. And that he's not just saying things, just talking things, and he won this fight.\n\nAs I said, he made a lot of promises, and he's not just going out and saying, look, I'll take care of this. There are people that will pay their respects and their kids will play in the streets. And I mean, as a matter of fact, he took care of them this summer. And it's not just one man who was in on the deal. It's two. And, you know, what that's going to do is they're on the same side of one another, and they were on very different sides of issues. And there were times when they just couldn't believe it.\n\nSo, you know, to", "length": 1024, "ended": false}

The hackers also exploited the China Daily's attack on the Hong Kong Exchange's trading system last spring, which triggered fears that Hong Kong might be a target for a cyber attack. (The Hong Kong Exchange's owner is a major party, one of the biggest, on cyber security issues.)\n\nAnd that was when one of China's biggest and most powerful financial companies took action.\n\n\"We have taken a significant step of trying to make sure that Hong Kong continues to be a place that the Internet is free and open and everyone will have the confidence that the Internet will be able to function as it is today,\" said John Wu, executive director of the New York-based Global Cyber Security, the consulting firm focused on cyber security in financial institutions.\n\nWu, who works at the Hong Kong-based think tank Baku University, said one of the big security problems from a Chinese attack on the Hong Kong Exchange's trading system may be the lack of cyber security.\n\n\"It is possible that we could lose information of the Exchange without an outside attack (in the country),\" said Wu. \"There might even be a hacker of the Chinese government who would use the cyber attacks, without us knowing. This is how it happens on a daily basis \u2013 when there's an attack.\"\n\nSome of the attack tools available at the Hong Kong Exchange's headquarters are designed to bypass these security checks, but in the case of China's biggest banks, one can't count on having any more than a dozen or so tools available.\n\nHong Kong's financial institutions, however, have been cracking down on hackers, which Wu said will help improve efficiency on the global platform in the coming months. They also have had to change a few other things about what they say are their tools, or, as he said, \"they are being hacked.\"\n\n\"They could change their procedures,\" Wu said. \"There have been cases where they have been hacked to prevent the government from taking action on issues (that) are really important. If you take action, you could get more power, and more people will have access to the information. That will help increase the quality of the banking services.\"\n\n\nSome bank officials say they're confident they'll make the right changes.\n\n\"I don't think it's going to be as hard to do,\" said Hui Huan, an economist at the Shanghai-based International Centre of Technology and Management (ICIMCM). \"We're making progress in building a system of the right type of protection against hacking as well as in a way it's safe.\"\n\nHe added: \"In an emergency or if the Chinese state is acting to protect itself or the system, such as when it's trying to shut down two-way connectivity, it's very important that we take action.\"\n\nRights groups say China is also using its cyber security as a way of controlling global finance. The Chinese government has been accused of blocking access to major corporations and of turning its Internet service into unsecured fiber-optic cables or a form of wireless telephone. The Chinese government even allowed a group of international finance conglomerates, including CFAI Bank, to shut down a key business in Beijing for two days this summer after a man used a tool used to target its banking services.\n\nBut Wu said those measures are largely up to the Chinese.\n\n\"We haven't seen any evidence of a state-sponsored cyber attack in the banking sector,\" he said. \"That is, if you look at the financial system, the banks aren't so vulnerable in all those ways.\"", "length": 838, "ended": true}

But if your brain is good and your mind is bad, how do you take out the bad stuff in the brain?\"\n\nJared Taylor has written two books. Now, in 2008, Jared Taylor wrote a book on how to create new emotions. In doing so, he made a few mistakes, including going back into the same room with his teacher, and talking about how \"mind-games\" are an extension of what you read and play a while ago. Taylor has written a series of essays on the topics of mindfulness and self-awareness. In his first book, \"Mindgames, How They Work,\" Jared Taylor discusses not understanding when people have to choose between a goal or a method to do something, which he calls \"an action that takes you outside of yourself in a new way.\" The way that Taylor talks about mind-games in a nutshell, is not a \"mind play that you take out of other people.\" It is merely an extension of how you \"think and feel and feel all the time.\" Taylor talks about what motivates you to engage in new ways, not how you can be your worst selves. What he believes in, it is important to be aware of, will guide and support you through the new ways you learn to live your life. This will enable you to stay motivated and keep going, and if you think one moment or another it will not make good news. But one must not think of one moment or other, but of the way the new world will make you feel.\n\nThe reason Jared Taylor takes so many lessons from Jared Taylor is because he sees the world in which he lives through. He wants to build a world that doesn't matter if you live in a different kind of world, one that respects the human soul and is compassionate and loving toward others. He wants you to build on this world, to live your life with compassion and love, to see your self in the new world and to get out of it.\n\nJared Taylor gives you a way to live your life now. He is a true expert, making life better for everyone, regardless of their background or circumstance. His books and podcasts are the best way to get involved, learn from each other, and build your community. The people he teaches with are really just like you: gentle, knowledgeable, thoughtful, and caring and thoughtful. Jared Taylor is not a stranger to the world of teaching because he was a first-generation New York City school teacher, from who he learned as a kid, and because the people he trains are all the same to his name. He writes with an intensity not found elsewhere in the world. He is a man in control, no matter how difficult or challenging. If you don't want to go around being your teacher, or make a bad mistake in your life, or just do not follow your own self-improvement goals for the sake of it or your family, Jared Taylor is here to help. He knows what to say and how to do it and how to talk about it all in the easiest way possible. He is the perfect teacher, a true, great teacher, and a very good friend to your life.\n\nThe best of Jared Taylor is his work. The best of a teacher and a master. He does this job for real, and his work is a real and heartfelt one. If you enjoy his book and podcasts you may have found your way into JT's world. Or if you prefer to hear a different voice every day, please feel free to listen to what he has to say and let him explain what he is going through in a different way. His teaching is free and open to anyone with the patience and the curiosity to speak his mind before the cameras. Jared in his book is also a wonderful companion.

{"id": 23, "text": "The second round of voting in the 2012 North American LCS tournament featured a split-soul split by a top-flight team: \"Torte de Lini\" (Natus Vincere) defeated Luminosity Gaming 4-3 last week to capture the top spot, then qualified for the playoffs.\n\n\"We're looking forward to the challenge next season,\" said head coach Adrian \"Torte de Lini\" Vasilyev during his interview with TheScore esports.\n\nA split-soul format had been used in the past for the NA LCS, when two teams were unable to qualify through a split-map. Now, in an attempt to take them out of the picture, they are still deciding which format goes with it.\n\n\"As far as the LCS is concerned, we do what the competition calls for -- not because we have to try and beat [Natus Vincere], but because it goes against some of the philosophies of what we do, and that's been our mentality over the past year and a half,\" said co-host Alex \"Sapphire\" Lee.\n\n\"We're very much looking forward to challenging ourselves every day, to getting as far as we can to make it through, and hopefully get another win and do what we did last week before the split-map. Obviously, we still have to prove it, we still have a number of other players that we can do well. We got to beat TSM and VP. We're just ready to prove the world that we can beat whoever we can at the top of the league.\n\nI don't know about you, but in the past we've been able to challenge ourselves at the top of the NA LCS. What's next for you?\n\nI mean, look at these results. We have got all these great coaches, players, all their teams now, who are all great, and have shown that we can play through this situation. I think the next step for TSM is getting over how things worked against us. Obviously, if they go there, with two top players in two different teams, that doesn't feel so good at all. So we have to start moving on from there and get it under control that we can do well and make it through each and every day to get to the top of the League, and make it a great championship season.\"\n\nThe biggest question on the face of the North American LCS is how do some of the key moves between this year's team and 2012 are happening?\n\nYou think we've gotten so far together, but I think we haven't got that much clarity. As far as the key questions we're going to have this year, I think we're able to play the way we did in the past. So when it comes down to that, the biggest question is how do we prepare?\" added TSM head coach and World Championship winner Dan \"Natus Vincere\" Rodriguez.\n\n\"Now that it's been over for about a week, that's really a big question. For us, that hasn't really been addressed for this year. We understand how difficult it is to play under pressure all the time. So we definitely feel we can get through it, but we are not going to play like we did last year, we're not going to make it to the playoffs. We are still not sure how we will make it. We know that we can make it over on day one, then, day one, we'll be ready to play the next two weeks of the season. But it's still a hard question to answer.\"\n\nIn the first six days of the North American League regular season, TSM suffered two losses in a three-way tie; the second half of the 2015 split had two winners; and the third quarter of the split had three teams finish in the region. While the two losses were good for a record that went a combined 2-1, the one victory of the split was also impressive in some ways.\n\n\"It has been about two weeks since we started qualifying this year. After those losses, it seemed like we could just focus on our preparation and focus on the playoffs. Now, we've just got to get a chance to face our next three opponents and do everything we can to qualify for the playoffs,\" said Lee. \"Our team has always been very focused on getting out there and showing our skills. We just have to get stronger each day and see how we are ready. It's pretty much like what you're used to.\"\n\nHow does this look before the split with Luminosity Gaming?\n\nYou look back at the season and you can see where this year was. I think TSM played well and we won. I have a good feeling we will play good. We are a team that is a really good team. This past week we were playing very well and we were able to win a big upset against TSM. And we still have a lot of work to do to go back", "length": 1024, "ended": false}

But the fact remains that North Korea has made a major strategic error in the past and will continue to do so, with the goal of building nuclear warhead technology. The most important lesson from this crisis is the potential to develop advanced weapons technology, but the country must stop its nuclear ambitions until this is decided. The media needs to recognize that many people in the world now have a clear picture of a North Korea with limited strategic capabilities and that the regime is still pursuing a limited nuclear arsenal. It is also important to recognize that even a limited nuclear capacity is unlikely to lead to a serious economic change.\n\nThis is a great lesson.

Williams, who was recently killed during the Battle of Attica, is buried at the cemetery of the U.S. First Lady's Tomb, which is in the vicinity of where the body was discovered, at Fort Lewis in Missouri. Williams, a four-star general and first secretary of the Marine Corps, was one of two Marine Corps officers involved in the attack that killed Williams and wounding 11 others at the site of the battle. (Maj. John R. Reynolds II/U.S. Army)\n\nPresident Trump's administration announced Wednesday that it will conduct a \"major\" review into whether the attack was not justified by law; it is still awaiting a legal opinion from U.S. District Judge James Robart on the charges. The investigation, which will include the finding that civilians had suffered serious violations of privacy and due process, involves an international investigation.\n\nThe investigation's findings will allow for better oversight, White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders told The Post. On Wednesday, the administration's response came a day after the Associated Press reported that an AP investigation revealed the same charges was leveled against a number of other U.S. military personnel and officers from around the world as well \u2014 including Marine Sgt. 1st Class Christopher T. Williams, who was killed in the battle while he was engaged in the operation.\n\nPresident Donald Trump's new administration and the Pentagon have said that their investigation did not find that the alleged perpetrators of the attack were not terrorists, but rather \"cooperative government leaders.\"\n\nThe AP's report also came as U.S. officials acknowledged Tuesday that intelligence agencies have concluded that a U.S. air force strike was targeted in France by jihadists, and that this had been part of a multi-week campaign that included bombings, military maneuvers, drone attacks and airstrikes on Muslim neighborhoods of the capital Paris. The officials say the administration's investigation will take place in light of the United States' public reaction to the Paris attack, which they said \"has prompted a renewed international effort to combat extremism in the Middle East.\"\n\nSome of the officials say their reports are too broad to describe directly through direct evidence but say their conclusions are based on \"very detailed and compelling evidence that the U.S. was engaging in deliberate terror against civilian targets within ISIS territory in Syria and Iraq, and was providing support to terrorists inside Syria or Iraq who were able to carry out the attacks.\"\n\nThe U.S. administration has expressed strong disapproval of the Paris attack but has not indicated how it would conduct a second inquiry in the wake of what it called the first. Under new President Trump, they have increased the threat from outside groups in a bid to counter American propaganda that portrays the United States as an aggressive and intolerant country, with the highest profile among them ISIS.\n\nTrump said last month that Americans had to \"deal with it, because it's a bad thing.\"\n\n\"I think we are going to deal with it, but I don't see it happening,\" he told radio host Hugh Hewitt Monday.\n\nSanders said in the AP report that the administration's findings would allow it to \"start looking at what was going on in Syria before we do this.\"\n\n\"So I think a lot of people will point to what was happening earlier,\" Sanders said. \"Not only did the U.S. allow the regime's (extremists) to be killed in Syria, a lot of other people have done that in other countries.\"\n\nOn Wednesday morning Sanders told reporters that American intelligence leaders concluded that the Paris strike was not a terrorist attack by ISIS. She acknowledged that Trump has raised the possibility that the Paris attack might have been carried out by U.S. forces but said no such evidence has arisen.\n\n\"The White House is clearly going to come up with these ideas and come to a consensus, but if there is one thing we're confident in, it's that if we have these types of conclusions, whether it's from us or from others, based on the best available evidence, then in that period, we're going to address it,\" Sanders said.\n\nTrump has made the public argument that it is \"very important for us\" that Washington do all it can to hold back the radical Islamist advance to Syria. Clinton has said she believes America should take that lead. She has also repeatedly criticized the Obama administration for its unwillingness to follow through on Trump's promises. He has suggested it should not pursue bombing of targets in Syria, a position both Republicans and the White House have declined to back, a position Sanders said was \"clearly not supported.\"\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press writer Jamiy Gabbard in New York, Steve Zitman in Cleveland contributed to this report.\n\n___\n\nInformation from: The Associated Press, Washington D.C.", "length": 998, "ended": true}
{"id": 27, "text": "SENIOR JUSTICE FRESHER: And it was the Senate's view that the Senate had an obligation not to act on a majority vote. Did that make sense?\n\nREP. WILLIAMS: First of all, the Senate has been instructed to vote as a whole. And I cannot recall the senators in the Senate who voted overwhelmingly to move ahead with the plan. We'll see what the House approves of it when we actually sit down. But in my view there was no question that the Senate would be unable to act. And what were the chances that there would be a minority vote on it? In my view, the Senate had its own authority, a majority vote. And I think it would be a very important point of difference of opinion in the House that is the difference of opinion on whether this is something we should do or not do so.\n\nSENIOR HON. ROGERS: One question, I'd like to ask you two, how does the law explain the fact that the Senate does not have an obligation to vote at all when the House is doing its own thing in a way that is contrary to the interest of the people?\n\nPRESIDENT TRUMP: Well, the Senate had an obligation not to vote on a majority vote on the issue of Obamacare, the very one that the House has been voting on in its own way since 2009. And so I was reminded last week that the Senate did not have an obligation to vote. I mean, it was not an obligation to the people. It wasn't an obligation.\n\nSENIOR MOUTH: All right. Good afternoon. Thank you.\n\nPRESIDENT TRUMP: Thank you.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nSENIOR HARRIS: We want to bring you back to your question from the last day of debate. One of the people I spoke with yesterday after the passage of the bill was the Speaker of the House, Richard Durbin. Durbin was asked a simple question about the bill and how the Congressional Budget Office had concluded there was \"no significant impact\" so as to put the bill on a path to enactment. He said it was a \"massive\" report made available to Congress. A question that came about about the CBO that was published for months afterwards was:\n\nMR. DURBIN: One thing that the CBO has discovered is that there is no significant negative health care impact after the passage of the House bill. And that is the way they looked at it. They just looked at the bill and they concluded that it would be a very large one. And the CBO has concluded that this bill would be a lot smaller than what it was at issue in 2009 or 2009 and did not see any significant impact there. And I want to respond further. The CBO is the CBO, after a thorough investigation of this bill, has concluded that the bill would not have a significant impact at all, even though it would have a small impact in some of the cases of the cases that the CBO had reviewed in its own report.\n\nSo, I think the CBO came out with a completely different assessment of the health care bill and then they did not conclude that the bill would not have any significant effect, even though it would have a modest effect in some cases. But I think it's more of a case of the CBO's own interpretation of the bill.\n\nHARRIS: If the House passes the bill, will the CBO release their own report to the American Health Care Act Congress, including the House vote on your answer for an open vote, to be taken before the final vote? And will the CBO also release their own report, which will contain the House vote on your answer, to determine, as I understand it, where we're going?\n\nPRESIDENT TRUMP: Well, we think, first of all, that the House vote on the bill would take place before the final vote with all the support of the American people. The House has done a tremendous job. In this regard, if it gets to a vote, it will be the result of the Senate committee. And I think the CBO has said all along -- you know, the CBO will be very skeptical of that, but there is a lot of support and you know the CBO has been able to get a bipartisan bill passed. And I think one of the things where I did get, you know, when I talked with Chairman Paul Ryan in our meeting with them recently, that I wanted to do this. I said, because, I mean, I have seen a tremendous amount of positive results for Medicare and Social Security.\n\nAnd that is what I'm trying to tell you right now. The CBO just published its numbers, and the Senate, including that, they have done a tremendous job so far, including a tremendous number of very good results, for Medicare and Social Security. And I look forward to seeing them get it done later. It's going to take the Senate.\n\n", "length": 1024, "ended": false}

The goal is to eliminate a 30 percent tax on certain types of health insurance.\n\nHouse and Senate health care negotiators also face a crucial deadline, which could come as early as Tuesday, where they can work through a series of key proposals, but Republicans hope to reach a compromise that's likely to have more substantive changes by next week.\n\n\"We're at a critical point,\" Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer, New York Democrat, said in a statement. \"House Democrats have done a great job drafting their bill. The House and Senate must do more on the issue.\"\n\nDemocrats have repeatedly expressed opposition to plans to repeal the health care law, which was passed in 2010. It's been an unpopular bill for Republicans.\n\nBut Senate Democrats say the GOP's healthcare plan is a great starting point for their effort in Congress to pass a replacement.\n\nThey said in a statement that they understand their members' desire to help advance the bill \u2014 despite concerns about the tax hikes.\n\n\"The bipartisan nature of this process \u2014 I know this because members of both parties and members of health care groups who are watching this closely \u2014 are saying they're very excited and we are eager to have them working through the discussion on health care reform and working together on passing and enforcing the bill,\" Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid (D-Nev.) said.\n\nDemocrats said the Senate and House are set to meet by Wednesday to consider their options, which have not been disclosed.\n\nA spokesman for Ryan did not return calls seeking comment from press outlets.\n\nObama's health-care proposal is a key focus of many in the healthcare debate. On Tuesday it emerged that Ryan had requested waivers on many controversial Obamacare provisions.\n\nAmong those is a measure allowing the government to buy health insurance through individual market exchanges, and a provision allowing employers to offer health plans through tax credits for those with pre-existing conditions.\n\n\"We have to protect, protect, protect and protect our workers\" from health insurance fraud, Republican National Committee Chairman Reince Priebus said Wednesday.\n\n\"This is just as concerning to health care providers as anything else you'll see in this country,\" he added.\n\nBut the White House official said the Obama administration has not decided yet if the bill will include new mandates and that it would be left to individual states and private insurers to take control of those, despite the government having said it was still working with other organizations to get these \"reforms up and running.\"\n\nRepublicans and Democrats have had discussions on how they can repeal the law. Democrats have called the House repeal a \"complete and utter win\" for GOP health-care plans because the individual mandate has been repealed entirely. Republicans point to the GOP-controlled Congress allowing for the government to buy health insurance through Obamacare exchanges.\n\nRepublican health reform proponents argue that the GOP repeal bill simply removes the mandate. That would help some small groups like low-income Americans to have access to healthcare for the full length of their lives, advocates say.\n\nIn a statement Wednesday, House Republicans defended allowing for an individual enrollment waiver to be expanded in 2018, saying the waivers would allow consumers to enroll by paying an individual premium instead of a standard, higher premium.\n\nHouse Republicans and Democrats can agree to such a waiver after a series of votes in the House.\n\n\"The Republican House's efforts to undo the Affordable Care Act are nothing short of astonishing,\" House Republican Campaign Director Ryan Lewis told reporters Wednesday.", "length": 815, "ended": true}

It was a routine incident that happened this spring, when three armed officers began punching and pepper spraying protesters as protesters and one student ran for cover.\n\nMore than a dozen protesters had gathered around the side of the sidewalk Monday and two others had gathered behind the police line in an effort to block off the school. The protesters were outnumbered by white protesters in a larger crowd with a long white beard that was often seen in public during the protests.

{"id": 31, "text": "The U.S. Government has been attempting to find out whether it has a legitimate interest in seizing a $4 billion (U.S.) worth of Chinese financial assets, and the U.S. Congress isn't too happy.\n\nThe Congressional Research Service report is entitled \"U.S. Government-Owned Financial Assets of the United States and Other Countries.\" The report lists seven entities it's currently analyzing in connection with \"the seizure and/or diversion of $500 billion or more.\" The organizations are all listed under \"foreign asset,\" which is not actually what is known.\n\nThis was all reported to the Treasury but the documents are made available in two separate batches of documents.\n\nThe first reports on Chinese-owned assets were published by the Treasury on November 6. The reports, from 2011 to 2014, included details on an estimated value of $300 billion (USD), but were also titled Chinese \"financial assets,\" under \"Foreign Assets\" as well as \"Chinese financial assets of all types.\" Both are listed under \"financial entities and other financial assets.\"\n\nThis money was seized in August 2016. The Treasury has made no public comment about whether they were interested in seizing any assets. As previously reported by the Wall Street Journal, the U.S. would be looking to seize all \"property or assets\" in China and other Central and Eastern Europe. It's unclear which of those assets might have been seized.\n\nThe latest report contains several references to other entities mentioned in the report, including the Central Bank of China, a bank owned by the Bank of China (BOC). These entities are listed as holding holders of $500 billion in assets, which is more significant than the actual amount.\n\nThe report also mentions that it's not clear whether the BOC had actual control over the companies, or whether it was a passive participant in the seizure.\n\nThe Treasury reports were originally published in the Wall Street Journal on October 20, 2015, and were part of Treasury's effort to identify and examine the Chinese government-owned financial assets.\n\n\"The U.S. government, which is responsible for ensuring national sovereignty and economic well-being, may not have sufficient oversight in China of such assets as assets of any kind, and may not have the necessary powers or responsibilities to conduct its own investigations. To the extent that the government of China possesses adequate oversight, other than by court order or through an executive order, of foreign financial assets of U.S. citizens or lawful permanent residents (excluding U.S. residents and permanent non-resident aliens),\" the Office of the Assistant Secretary for Financial Services and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OPAC) wrote in a separate letter outlining the findings.\n\nThe agency also cited other matters that were highlighted in some of the reports:\n\nthe extent to which the U.S. government, which was entrusted with the control of financial assets outside of its custody, has not had any oversight of its own financial systems, including those held by central banks\n\nin the United States.\n\nThe agency also noted that the BOC has been linked to China in a number of reports.\n\nWhat was also reported: Treasury has also said it has not had any \"direct experience in Chinese financial institutions, or in a foreign institution connected to such institutions.\"\n\nThe U.S. government has been conducting its own investigations into how much money Chinese officials had in its possession. According to the Wall St Journal, a former HSBC employee is in custody, including a senior leadership team who has been accused of being heavily involved in China-related money laundering schemes. The Associated Press reported that a HSBC employee has previously received a five-month house arrest after working as part of an international network for the Chinese government.\n\nThe Chinese government has not provided details on how much it controls foreign banking assets.\n\nThe China Daily reported that the Treasury was seeking to figure out how much the U.S. government is now being kept under the rubric of \"foreign assets.\" A spokesman for the Treasury Department told the Daily: \"The Treasury's approach does not have the same degree of control as does the European Commission, the U.N. and any other governmental body. That means the U.S. Government and Treasury have less control over foreign banks that have the authority to take on foreign assets.\"\n\nThe Treasury did offer a suggestion that China may be taking advantage of a new American financial security system at the expense of its own security system.\n\nIn May 2016, the Treasury also found that JPMorgan Chase had been engaging in financial and commercial misappropriation practices with the Chinese government, as well as using it to defraud Chinese banks.

{"id": 32, "text": "Fifty percent of the population, approximately 7 million, has experienced a mental illness. Approximately 2 million of the US population have severe depression, and these disorders were responsible for about half of all mental illnesses.\n\nIn other words, this means that a person has an anxiety disorder, or a serious disorder or disease on a spectrum ranging from mild to severe. In other words, it means that they have a disability and this is one of the main reasons why they are unable to get regular therapy, but the other two major factors that are contributing to it all include anxiety. One of the major factors that is contributing to one's not getting enough therapy in a psychiatric hospital is their lack of social skills and work life. These are the factors that will be responsible for an individual with major depression to suffer such a severe distress from such a disorder.\n\nThe other major factor in one's being dependent on and being unable to get regular attention is their need to get more of what they think is helpful, which is more useful to them because it also encourages them to be more active in their social life. This also means they have the need to be more active that they should be to the other side. Also known as active, inactive or inactive or \"less active\" they feel more depressed and less self-confident because they are less willing to get involved. This is the major factor that keeps people with a mental illness at their current level of anxiety.\n\nWhat is the reason for living with a disorder that is causing them some stress to actually live?\n\nWhat is the explanation for living with a mental illness that can cause them some stress to actually live?\n\nAs I said in my previous post, if we look at a number of cases of an individual living with a mental illness, some of it is just because they are not working. They want to \"move on,\" and the fact that they don't realize how important it is to not have a job will also create what I consider to be a psychological problem for the individual. Therefore, we have no idea where that mental illness is coming from and how to solve it if the individual doesn't do something about it.\n\nThe second major answer being that the person that is living with a mental illness is more aware of why they are not trying but there has to be a way they can get help to help out. When we think about it, it is really not about them because if the other person with an anxiety disorder or mental illness comes in and tries to change things for another person without their permission, then you cannot treat an individual with an anxiety disorder.\n\nHow do things work and what can you do about it if you decide to get help for an anxiety disorder that you are not working on?\n\nYou don't have to get help for a mental illness. It is all of your right to have a supportive life that you can support yourself with. If you decide to go through an evaluation at a mental health service you can get support for mental health if you tell someone who might be affected by your disorder you aren't. What you do have is your own opinion about what is best, and if it is best to be with someone else you have to do what you think that is right then. What you can do is to have a discussion about the options for an assessment of what you would like to do, so that you can be less in the position of taking an opinion as a judge or at an appointment with your doctor. This is one of the best ways to go about being more supportive for an individual with an anxiety disorder than you would be if they were living in a home in a remote part of the world, and that is what you have to do and you have to give permission.\n\nCan you help one of your friends or family with something?\n\nDo the things that I discussed in my previous post, such as your life situation and family situation, and the way they interact with you to be able to give approval for their future and to make sure they don't get anything wrong, be in a good family mood.\n\nHow does the condition work?\n\nWe have to think the way people go about life in the ways that people in certain situations think.\n\nWhat does the condition take place in your family?\n\nSome people will be physically ill and this illness can take on the form of illness. As many as 1,000 of one-third of American adults with anxiety often have a family member or sibling that is affected with an anxiety disorder, and people from the family generally deal with it from very often that is not very helpful. Sometimes children feel isolated and afraid. This can cause people to feel very isolated, but often people who are affected with anxiety tend to have a sense of community and a sense that they live in a safe environment. These problems are sometimes referred to as \"mental illness.\" These symptoms affect a person who is very often anxious or anxious about the way the way the world feels.

{"id": 34, "text": "Uranium-238 is a nuclear fuel used in nuclear reactor research. In recent years it has been used to build atomic bombs.\n\nHistory Edit\n\nAccording to the Wikipedia article \"Uranium-238\", Uranium was produced in 1955 under a special project called \"Z-12\".\n\nIt is believed that it was discovered by two of the world's wealthiest people: Charles Darwin, in 1961, and Albert Einstein, in 1974, where they discovered that uranium is of isotopes that change slightly with each passing year. By 1988, though uranium had been around as long as 2.5 billion years, it was discovered by the German engineer Hans E. M\u00fcller who was to the first atomic bomb the American physicist Richard Feynman was to detonate at his base in London in December 1957.\n\nThe uranium used in today's Uranium-238 reactors, which is the second most abundant natural element among the Earth's stars, is made of two materials, silicon and thorium, which are found in all asteroids, comets, and asteroids.\n\nSince 1987, more than 5,000 people have died or been killed by uranium mining because of U.S mines on the West Coast. Despite these deaths, uranium-239 is one of the most widely used elements in American uranium production. Uranium-239 has been found extensively in the United States and Canada, which has made it an extremely safe isotope by its very nature.\n\nSince 1987, uranium mines have operated on the uranium from the Mariana Trench Mine in the Northern Mariana Islands and two other mine sites. Some of these mines had uranium extraction capacity of 50 million tons, though a second mine, located in southern Hawaii, has a capacity to produce up to 100 million tons, or roughly 50% more of what the Mariana Trench mine produces. Although uranium mines on the West Coast are technically still within the jurisdiction of U.S. federal agencies, the government agencies within the jurisdiction of the federal Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, and Explosives, all of whom also have some jurisdiction in determining the limits on uranium production or enrichment in the mines.\n\nAs of 2007, at least 14 billion tons of uranium was released from the Mariana Trench Mine and a total of 12 billion tons of uranium oxide was also released from the Mariana Tunnel mine in Hawaii.\n\nDuring the Cold War era, scientists have been concerned about U.S. uranium production and mining for at least five years. This was because both the U.S. and other international governments have been unable to determine a viable uranium production rate and thus were afraid that uranium-239 (and uranium-242) would not be able to find commercial use. The U.S. has been able to determine the number of uranium ore-bearing blocks of the Mariana tunnel from an unlicensed mining company that has also been in production in the North Atlantic, a practice known as \"double-crossing\" for extracting and storing. These uranium ore-bearing fragments cannot be used as a base for enrichment. If uranium-238 were to be placed inside of the U.S. mine's mine gate, it would be sent directly to the North Atlantic, where the U.S. mining company would produce its own waste. The North Atlantic would then be an alternate source of uranium for U.S.-produced uranium, and not a source of uranium for U.S.-produced uranium.\n\nThere was also concern that U.S.-produced uranium ore might be used for other purposes besides uranium extraction, such as for military purposes. U.S.-produced uranium, however, is not produced for military applications as a fuel to nuclear power plants and other energy sources. Most U.S. uranium ore-bearing blocks of the Mariana tunnel are found at the nearby Mariana Trench site, which is one of the largest and most productive uranium ore-bearing blocks of the West Coast.\n\nDuring the Cold War, the U.S. government's concerns over Uranium-232 in the United States were exacerbated with the discovery of the Uranium Iron Oxide Mine in Tennessee. As of 1993, more than 6.8 billion tons of uranium ore were being mined and mined at that site by U.S. production companies. This also included uranium-238 in the form of uranium-238, which was discovered in 1986. That uranium was discovered by a US company known as Breslau (whose name also translates as the Uranium Institute), which produced two Breslau iron ore blocks, one containing uranium-238 and one containing uranium-232.\n\nUranium-238 was discovered by a US company known as Breslau (whose name also translates as the Uranium Institute), which produced two Breslau iron ore blocks, one containing uranium-238 and one containing uranium-232. U.S. workers at the site were forced to pay for uranium-238 by miners from other countries who wanted a higher rate of U.", "length": 1024, "ended": false}

The country can no longer afford to pay its debts and to spend money, and it has begun to shrink its size. But the situation is not quite what it was one would hope.\n\nIn response to a series of new crises, governments are taking more drastic measures to make the crisis less severe. In an unprecedented move, President Donald Trump has vowed to build a wall between Mexico and the United States, a policy that has had a negative effect on the nation's finances.\n\nThe president issued his first budget on Monday, saying that the U.S. will not do more to alleviate the crisis \u2014 one of more than five budget priorities in its eight years of political existence. The U.S. is now spending around $20 billion a year on infrastructure projects. That compares with the $26 billion and $34 billion spent in the past five years by countries such as China and China-EU, according to the National Center for Policy Analysis.\n\nA new report released Thursday by the Congressional Budget Office shows that spending on roads and public works over the past seven years is projected to be higher than last year. That is due both to the expansion of private investment in roads, water and sewer systems, and the continued expansion of Medicaid through the Affordable Care Act.\n\nThe president's decision comes as he signs controversial controversial travel restrictions and bans on the travel of refugees and citizens of seven majority-Muslim nations, as well as a new policy to force Muslims to disclose their citizenship status.\n\nUnder the Trump administration, the President signed a sweeping list of immigration-related issues that the Congressional Budget Office reported on Thursday, including a $10.8 trillion budget plan for the federal government, including the border wall and a major tax cut for the wealthiest Americans. The tax cut has the potential to generate nearly $10 billion a year in economic growth.\n\nPresident Trump signed an executive order last month to increase the size of the U.S. workforce and increase the size of the National Guard. In March, President Trump ordered a temporary 90-day ban on citizens of seven Muslim-majority nations and on Syrian refugees.\n\nThe move was criticized by some Democrats, who argued that the new order is taking too long to implement.\n\n\"We don't pay our fair share to our veterans and our law enforcement,\" California Rep. Adam Schiff, the ranking member of the House Intelligence Committee, said at a press conference.\n\n\"We take a very, very hard line on it.

Mark Pocan, California Democratic leader.\n\nDemocrats said the order was intended to protect U.S. military veterans that were returning to school and those who came to the Middle East when they left the military.\n\nThe Pentagon said late Tuesday that it has sent about $1 trillion toward training and advising troops abroad and that in FY15 nearly 2.6 million U.S. troops will stay in Afghanistan. The additional funds are needed to train about 100,000 U.S. troops annually with the help of a new \"surge in\" and \"reserve surge.\"\n\nThe Pentagon is the biggest U.S. military contractor in the world and a major producer of military-level services. Lockheed Martin Corp. and Boeing Co. have agreed to invest $1 trillion in Afghanistan as the Afghan Government grapples with a political and economic crisis.\n\nSome lawmakers in the House of Representatives said the Pentagon should have already seen the new directives and plans ahead of time, noting that the Pentagon's budget cuts in recent years have had a significant impact on hiring and spending in the United States.\n\n\"Our budget is an outgrowth of our war on terror and more of a consequence of the fact that you know these are tough decisions,\" said Rep.

But he's not alone. NBA.com reporter Joe Schaw writes that this situation might be coming to an end anytime soon, so the Cavaliers will be taking the long view on his play to avoid his shoulder injury.\n\nHere are some of our favorite questions asked about the Cavs' move to free agency after the All-Star break.\n\n\n1. Does James need replacement money?\n\nJames said when it was made clear that he did not want his salary to go down, he told reporters that he would not let his shoulder get into a game until after free agency.\n\nAsked by the official Cavs team press conference if James wanted to give up a spot in the NBA Finals for playing a different position, Cavs coach Tyronn Lue said, \"Certainly I can't,\" James responded.\n\nAfter the Cavaliers opened on July 4 with another loss, James took it on face, saying he had been having trouble in training camp with his shoulder. But it seemed like another reason to leave the game.\n\nJames says he's already gotten a lot of help from coach David West, but he says he still believes the Cavs can reach an agreement with Cleveland in free agency.\n\n2. Is it any secret LeBron doesn't want to spend this money again?\n\nAs we reported last night, James told a confidante on Twitter that he'd \"never said that,\" because the Cavs were looking to re-sign him instead of bringing him back.\n\n\"If I'm traded, I'd like to see the Cavs get back what they need,\" James told the Times. \"But I'm just not able to. I've seen a lot of stuff where they got to the point where I can't come back because of the way I play, that's not how playing basketball is. LeBron told me last night that he wouldn't play another year because of the way I played. ... I hope I can do the right thing. It's a long run there, I'm not sure about this one.\"\n\n3. Is James not in the trade deadline market?\n\nSo far, LeBron isn't close to being done with the Cavaliers. But the Cavs want another big name that could be able to push through and make a playoff run this season.\n\nOn top of the question of whether or not James would continue on in the NBA, some in Cleveland are suggesting that he could be able to be traded to Golden State.

{"id": 38, "text": "As seen before, in 2008, Republican presidential nominee Mitt Romney had the support of 32.7 million Americans as of Jan. 1st, which is just before the New Hampshire primary on February 2nd. (The previous high was 30.5 million.) It also follows the same pattern for 2008: Republicans have seen as many as 1 in 3 Republican primary voters in the GOP primary race; only 1 in 3 Republicans have voted in the primaries in 2012 \u2013 a change of just 0.7 percentage points from the previous two years.\n\nWhy the shift in support from Republican voters to Democrats? It is because as we have seen, Romney's position as the \"top choice\" of both major parties over Obama has changed significantly with the national election in recent years. (That shift was caused by a change in the Republican primary electorate that included both Romney and Obama.) In his interview with George Stephanopoulos yesterday, Romney admitted that Obama won the popular vote in 2010, but said he will still win the popular vote if he is elected president when he meets with a full slate of his party's presidential candidates in the final weeks of May. However, if Romney loses the popular vote and becomes Democratic president, he would become the first person elected to the presidency since Reconstruction in 1789 to have won the popular vote while a second party controlled the White House as president.\n\nRomney also explained why he supports the current Democratic nominee Donald Trump in the coming primary debate. According to The Daily Beast, Romney said: \"Our party establishment and our media don't want to have more people who can take the heat for their positions that some of our voters have taken for years.\" He further explained: \"If we want more people to see the political reality, then why not just tell the truth, and tell all the facts about what has been proven about our position so that people can have their own views heard? That doesn't mean you have to put a man on the moon and say all these things.\"\n\nBut as the Huffington Post notes:\n\nEven if you take a more conservative approach, Republican primary voters will still overwhelmingly dislike Trump on the political side in a contest that includes his \"war on women.\" But if you're paying close attention, the results show that Romney will have a huge lead over Trump by the midterms -- because he will not have the votes of the Republican primary electorate which will have to come from Trump because Romney won the popular vote (or at least more than 4.6 million more voters, if you count Romney's 2012 electoral votes). In other words, if Romney loses the popular vote, if Obama loses the popular vote, he is still going to be the top choice to win the popular vote.\n\nIn order to win the popular vote, Republicans need to have a big base in the Senate and have at least 2,000 electoral votes total up for grabs in 2018. Then, the president can claim victory in the Electoral College (unless Romney is a Democrat) and he can win his presidency without having to win all states for the same. So the only option available is to defeat Trump and win the popular vote, or if he wins the popular vote (and wins a majority for the Democratic presidential electorate) then we see a dramatic shift, but the GOP can still win the presidential election without losing all states.\n\nAnd, of course, it is important not to overstate how difficult the Republican Primary is. Even an optimistic Republican like Trump would have a problem winning the popular vote if not for his overwhelming success in 2016, with only four weeks remaining to play.\n\nHowever, even if Trump ends up with the White House, he can easily be forced to win a majority in the Senate. He can also easily win states in which he does not currently have the votes, such as Alaska, Montana, and Nevada. The same was said of Obama in 2008, and now Romney and Obama are the only two Democratic candidates that Romney would have a good chance of winning in 2008.\n\nBut don't get too caught up on the numbers. There's a lot less data to go around. When it comes to the race between Trump and Romney, it doesn't depend on any exact percentage of electoral votes, as they generally take a different form. But by using exit polls (and exit polls themselves) as the deciding factor, we've got this.\n\nAccording to The Donald's Guide to the 2016 Republican Primary , the popular vote is still split evenly between all 4 major parties, and only 17% of Republicans say that this makes them \"winners.\" But in the end, that's the final nail in a very big win for the GOP on January 20th: a record-setting 8.1 million people voted during the Democratic primaries in 2016. The same number who voted for Mitt Romney had a huge effect on the outcome. In fact, a majority of them voted for Democrat Hillary Clinton:\n\nOf the 8.1 million registered voters who stayed home to vote, 572 made it to the states to participate in the primary\n\n\nSome", "length": 1024, "ended": false}
{"id": 39, "text": "\nIt's always been that way, until it was brought over from France. It's only on Christmas and New Year's Eve it really hits home.\n\nWhen I brought it to Europe I was shocked for a long time. I've never seen such good quality European produce. It was not something I expected. But now I'm just amazed.\n\nOne of the biggest things we did in the past was to take it out and produce it at just about any time. We produced it at all the time, usually right in the back garden, in the autumn or on any sort of special day. Even when not on Christmas Eve we kept it in a big box in our garden. It had just been cut down in Germany and put to use on the farms in France. It's the oldest kind of wood ever made and it's amazing. There's so much beauty in it.\n\nThere were so many amazing things, the most amazing things at a time. This was the first time when they actually made wood. But now we can produce it at any time.\n\nI want to share a little bit of that with you. I think if you want to make good quality Scandinavian wood then it's just that easy to produce it.\n\nLet's talk about the origin of woodworking. I want to talk about it some more.\n\nBefore we do that I'll give you a couple of tips. First of \"the whole world is a workshop\". There's a huge market for wooden work and I don't think everybody is very involved in how they're used, but to me there's just never any question as to why we go about making things or not.\n\nIf you're talking about, for example, a woodworking box, you've got a box with a small amount of wood and you've got something like a saw. And you cut some of the wood up with a saw and you want to lay a large sheet of wood over the saw and have a bit of a \"cutout\" of the wood. Well, this is done at least in Germany, in Belgium, in England. You cut the wood and put the saw on it.\n\nYou also use a saw for the saw. You then get some wooden dowel on top of that. And the saw goes into the furnace. And you'll notice that there's a hole in the wall around it.\n\nSo that's how the wood is laid out. You place that in the furnace, that's where you put the wood, what you put into it and then the saw goes through all of that. So it's like a saw that gives you a little bit of weight. The same way you put a saw on the top of the wood you're putting it on on a machine.\n\nIf you're talking about being able to make anything at home, that means it takes years to get to where it's needed. But for anyone who loves an artisan, to the point where it's possible to learn how to make something to their own specifications and then use that to build something for them it's not that hard, you just have a different kind of experience and then the best experience you have here is with a workshop.\n\nNow you get to know the tools that you're using, you look at what's been done before and you say what you want to do in terms of building something, where you want it to go. And you want it to make its own kind of sound and you want a bit of a sense of proportion when you're making it, when you're working and so on. These are things that actually are useful.\n\nNow we know they're needed, but they're all so much stronger than a single piece of wood you can do. So it must be done at a much more specific, very specific, specific level. So it's very important we go back a little bit. When we talk about wood and woodworking a lot of times that's because of some level of specialization within the crafts people take from us.\n\nNow we're not there yet but it's hard when we say to the other people: \"Well I've seen this little box, what's the most important thing you are working on?\". We actually see people working with this box before people bring it into the house and that's the main thing, just to get some sense of the level and to try and use it in a certain way. But it's just an idea.\n\nThere are things that you can do with wood that you probably will want to work on. You can do it in different ways, but it's something that will give you the skills you need to do it that way.\n\nSo what we should definitely do is just make the things that we want to do. And then make them as small as possible so that you're not trying to do as many of them on a regular basis as you want to.\n\nI think when you really understand how things are made you'll understand that", "length": 1024, "ended": false}

State Department records are not official records that are classified \u2013 rather, they are a matter of state law and were passed on to an individual for review.\n\nOn March 4, 2015 Hillary Clinton testified before the House Select Committee on Benghazi and did not share a State Department cable \u2013 it was a State Department cable, and the committee did not hear emails from the State Department. The FBI investigation has not been completed and remains unclear. On June 12, 2015, the FBI interviewed Hillary Clinton while she was secretary of state and found all of Clinton's emails were in a secure secure server.\n\nHer campaign chairman John Podesta admitted on Sunday that she made a false statement to the State Department's inspector general, in a letter sent to the FBI's top ethics officer following the Department's investigation into her handling of classified information during her time in office.\n\nAt the time, Donald Trump said, \"They may as well have destroyed that.\" However, he later said he wouldn't know if his former campaign manager, Paul Manafort, and former campaign manager Rick Gates were involved in any illegal meetings between Hillary Clinton and her staff.\n\nThe FBI investigation of her server was still ongoing, despite the fact that the House Judiciary Committee had determined that Hillary Clinton did not do one thing wrong when releasing her messages to the public. The FBI ultimately concluded that all of the information on the server was properly classified and that it should not be released publicly without proper review.\n\nOn May 8, 2015, Clinton emailed her top aides at the State Department. While secretary of state, she also admitted that her campaign paid money to \"people who had nothing to do with the Clintons so far.\" The State Department found that she had \"received no formal requests to take any action against the individuals, their contractors, or individuals with whom Clinton served,\" including money, the State Department had \"no indication that her emails or other documents were in any way associated with her official duties but was merely being used for 'personal or business purposes,' and did have 'no intent to cause undue distress to the State Department or her staff.'\"\n\nAfter being sworn in as the nation's longest-serving president a month later, Clinton faced charges of obstruction of justice by officials with the FBI, the IRS and other federal agencies over mishandling of her private email server.\n\nAs for the FBI probe into her emails, the Clinton campaign did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nIn March, President Barack Obama and Vice President Joe Biden both publicly acknowledged that Secretary of State Clinton, a Democrat at the time, had not properly classified information because all her emails were in a secure, unsecured server.\n\nThe FBI is still investigating whether Clinton colluded with the Russians, her campaign did not release the State Department classified information or the Clinton campaign did not fully clear Clinton's personal computer.\n\nAccording to a report from Politico, \"the Obama administration said all the emails in the records were in the Clinton account, which is the same account to which she was a party that had her account deleted for political reasons.\"\n\nThe Obama administration said \"that if they are correct that the emails were in the account they are not illegal and that they were simply a failure on a number of a number of Clinton's part-time political employees.\"\n\nA day later, Clinton's national security staff released a statement saying, \"We are disappointed that Ms. Clinton had this much trouble in trying to provide a truthful account to the American people.\" The statement said Clinton \"wasn't a major political changeer or a major candidate.

It takes the reader through the course of two weeks of a five-year-long, open-to-the-public tour of the U.S., including conversations with American students who had learned from Borka. It's a well conceived book. Borka's goal isn't to create an English version, but to present a better one. He's trying to make it as accessible to readers as possible, through language and texts that are both in the French style and also in the English format.\n\nBorka says he's learned \"from hundreds of other French intellectuals who did just that.\" It's not the sort of thing you find in Borka's English. There were plenty of other academics who taught English and French at different times, but this was the biggest change in Borka's world view. The book focuses on the many things that made his world, especially in France.\n\n\"A lot of the things that made my life difficult were the ideas and the attitudes that came through,\" Borka said. The key was to talk to students and take them along with the French education. \"This is a very different thing when you try to teach a French language in a very different style.\"\n\nIn the case of Borka, he learned that a lot of people thought that he was being unfair by using his English. But a larger change came when he started to use French as a shorthand for describing foreign things. \"I learned French by doing this exercise,\" Borka says, to get students to understand what they were being told when they were trying to write a book.\n\nThe book is well-researched, but there's so much to be learned in Borka's world view. He cites some of French's most famous authors, who include Marcel Proust and Fran\u00e7ois G\u00e9rard, as examples. He explains that if a person's main goals don't include getting more money for his or her food \u2014 or by doing things like organizing a lunch for family \u2014 he should give them what he or she's already got. His example also suggests that when a person's goal is money, but not being an efficient entrepreneur \u2014 say, investing in something like a social media site or a mobile app \u2014 they are trying too hard. Borka says there is a lot of other interesting and influential writers who were trying to do that too.\n\nThe book's subtitle reads, \"You do, don't you?\"\n\nThere are five sentences per sentence. In my case, for those who don't care for the text, I am a little confused \u2014 I think that is the right word \u2014 so I try to do everything in all five sentences. Borka also emphasizes that many people are already planning the book. For example, I try to use a word like huette, meaning \"doom,\" or \"the beginning of the age of civilization\" \u2014 in English this is about the \"recovery of mankind from the bondage of feudalism,\" \"the beginning of the age of democracy,\" or \"a very dangerous stage in which everything is being destroyed; and so on,\" and \"in the next few days all that is going to stop will go away because the masses understand that capitalism is going to stop.\"\n\nAnd I am making these choices, and this is where I try to do things more subtly. I try to say more directly and forcefully that capitalism can, and does,", "length": 1024, "ended": false}

And in July, the RCMP opened an investigation into the same organization over allegations some of the RCMP-provided documents allegedly showing that some officers at a Canadian Air Force training facility in Canada operated a weapons training center and carried out training aimed at a terrorist network.\n\n\"All of this has been described as a violation of law by the RCMP,\" said defence lawyer Richard Zeevkin in an appeal filed last month in the Ottawa district court for the District of North Dakota.\n\nZeevkin is representing U.S. Army Lt.-Gen. Paul Crouse in his appeal of his dismissal, which ended on December 4. The Supreme Court of Canada in Washington, D.C., refused his motion on a motion filed on June 20. The Supreme Court, in an order published Wednesday in federal court in Toronto, granted Zeevkin's motion saying the RCMP \"can't be trusted to investigate serious offences of this nature under the Canada Criminal Code.\"\n\nSince the beginning of 2015, a number of RCMP officials from the Department of National Defence and the Public Safety Intelligence Service working with U.S. and other government and military security agencies have been at Canadian military installations, while U.S. military and RCMP officials have stayed out of any discussion with Canadian security officials there.\n\nThat includes Crouse and the former U.S. Army and U.S. Coast Guard officer and National Guard chief Keith Turner-Olin. They recently visited the RCMP training facility to discuss security concerns over attacks in Canada and to try to figure out how Canadian military and police officers could engage with the groups' foreign-trained fighters.\n\nIn its reply to Zeevkin's appeal, the Supreme Court of Canada wrote, \"The only Canadian military training facility that appears to be responsible for a terrorist-related threat is located in Quebec, Canada.\"\n\nZeevkin in his appeal argued that, even if the RCMP had investigated the events in Winnipeg and Montreal, none of Canada and other jurisdictions could fully investigate and prosecute the allegations.\n\nZeevkin, the lawyer, asked for \"a special meeting with the Special Operations Forces (Special Forces) to address those questions.\"\n\nThe Supreme Court on Wednesday said it would not comment on the question of whether a government-provided document made available to police and law enforcement organizations in foreign jurisdictions might help them locate and arrest people operating in such countries.\n\nZeevkin wrote that RCMP officers who participated in the Calgary training center and the training of a number of people from abroad who have served with the Calgary branch and the RCMP are not legally entitled to the document that allows them to work with the Canadian Security Service through the Canadian Centre for the Defence of Civilian Persons, which was established in 1996 and is governed by the Canadian Criminal Code.\n\nHe said the RCMP document makes clear that a person operating in one of four designated combat zones within a Canadian city cannot be questioned.\n\nZeevkin added that under the regulations of Canadian law, an officer in a combat zone cannot be held liable.\n\n\"This is not only contrary to the United Nations Convention for the Protection of Children, but also contrary to the Charter rights of Canadians,\" he said in an appeal filed with the Superior Court of Canada. \"There is no evidence whatsoever that anyone in any of the above circumstances has ever been subjected to questioning in any Canadian military or police facility. . . It's an absolute, absolute prohibition, and there is no basis for this to be allowed.\"\n\nPolice and security groups across the country have been accused of using Canadian military and law enforcement officers to do terrorist activities and conduct other forms of terrorism.\n\nThe RCMP has never been accused of using those same military and police officers to commit acts of violence, Zeevkin said.\n\nThe RCMP, however, says it has nothing to hide that it is operating in a country with a large Muslim population and is operating within a limited scope of how it can function with a limited number of trained federal and provincial staff.\n\n\"I also believe that you could do much worse to the people who operated in this country,\" Zeevkin told CBC news when asked about what he thought happened at the training center on June 11. \"This is an ongoing conversation which is ongoing.\"\n\nThe RCMP says it has opened an investigation into the allegations.\n\nU.S. and Canadian governments have condemned what they describe as \"incidents\" at Canada's training, saying they were not coordinated or directed by U.S. and Canadian political officials.

{"id": 47, "text": "Preliminary data\n\nThe latest estimates from the Institute of Social Justice indicate that between 2000 and 2005, between 1,900 Americans were charged with a \"serious violent crime,\" ranging from driving under the influence (that's about four times more than the crime involving a car) to possession of a firearms (which is over two times as many). That's almost twice as many people charged in a single incident than charged every time. That's not entirely surprising; the crime is the most deadly in the nation. But it's not something that's easy to say. As a young man, I remember one violent incident in which I was in a situation where the police were just standing over me, so in both cases it was clear I was a victim. The violent crime statistics for the 50 states do not indicate many, if any, states might not have been the one that did.\n\nA few years ago I did an interview with the National Center on Missing and Exploited Children. What I learned was that although it appears that at least a third of all people in all 50 states are victimized by the crime of car theft and the average amount of car damage is three to five times greater (as of 2009-10), this percentage has steadily decreased in the three years between 2010 and 2009. In some states, where car thefts have reduced and property thefts increased, a greater percentage of people are victimized per stolen vehicle and less is stolen per stolen property.\n\nCar theft has declined dramatically since 1993, in part (but not altogether) because the average owner of an abandoned and wrecked car has decreased. But if there are two reasons that car thieves have declined, it's a lack of the opportunity, which would have resulted in a decrease in theft. If there are two, then the victims (and car thieves) have increased the opportunity per stolen car and it seems likely that at least part of the increased chance is due to other incentives.\n\nA third scenario:\n\nAs I was writing this, my college girlfriend, who is not involved in a car theft story, contacted me and encouraged me to write about the \"crime of car theft\" in the paper that she was writing on the subject with some of her fellow college students at the time. She also pointed out that many of the stories she wrote were for articles and that many of them were written about crime in the papers I had already written. To my surprise, she said that for the most part, her research had uncovered some interesting differences in data between states with a different crime, although the difference in the states and results on data on crimes between states did not indicate whether these differences were of significance in this case. She found that in Florida and Mississippi, the state that she was writing about had a similar degree of crime statistics when looking at the statistics on car theft. She also found that there was a slight difference in theft rates, because of how a car thief had a vehicle stolen without going into and driving it out of a vehicle dealership in a different state. That's interesting, because even when people who want to tell stories about such things can't, they are often forced into their stories. In a recent New York Times column about the car theft story, I summarized what I found:\n\nI have become aware of instances of young people in Florida and Alabama who are very scared of car theft and who are trying to talk about whether cars really are the only things that they should drive. They can't explain to me that it's a big deal. But, there are, and for some reason there are many older people in Florida who are so worried about their car's worth that one week I'm going to drive the car I bought on eBay and I'm going to pay a little more for it, and I'm hoping that we can figure it out.\n\nMany of these young people are living at home with their parents, friends, and even relatives in South Carolina, Mississippi, and elsewhere. They've been warned by the police, or \"stealing\" the vehicle. This \"mixed\" category of car thieves, which is why the media have had trouble getting them to write about it.\n\nThe problem with this kind of reporting is that it ignores the whole situation. While the \"car theft\" statistic does represent the vast majority of car theft incidents but more than 90% of cases were in black car dealerships, it is far more likely because there are multiple stores that are responsible for selling different styles of stolen cars, and because many consumers are too afraid to talk about this in local newspapers that cover these types of incidents.\n\nThere may be at least some truth to this. A few states have experienced much higher car theft rates, like California. And it was a large chunk of traffic in California on Sundays that led to people getting killed or injured. And there was no police presence on the weekends or early morning hours.\n\nThere are plenty of areas where such reports of car thefts would not have produced much evidence.

{"id": 48, "text": "It's the old adage that you never know, or so I thought, in a moment, when I woke up in the middle of summer, with six degrees of cold.\n\nBut we aren't in winter, and cold temperatures are a huge drag on a body.\n\nBut I did find that my body started to feel \"normal.\" I still feel great, even after taking a lot of exercise once every week, and my metabolism has not been altered much in my 12 months.\n\nBut there's another, non-mainstream \"healthy\" body part I've found: bone, in fact. And while the science for my bones is still still very rudimentary, there is a growing body of research showing that there is a link between bone density and the level of inflammation that affects joints for the better.\n\nIn the past decade, studies have shown a \"long-lasting\" connection between bones and inflammation. \"For decades, studies have shown that bone density is a biomarker of inflammation and that inflammation is related to chronic disease progression and disease severity\" in particular, according to a study from UC Davis and Harvard University. In fact, researchers also found that the same thing happened in people with different degrees of inflammation.\n\nHow can that be true?\n\nAs I write this, a study published in the journal PLoS ONE found this link in nine different women after they underwent body-specific assessment at a body mass index (BMI). Women who had a baseline of less than 30 at baseline were also tested for higher levels of inflammation than non-men.\n\nThe study also found more women felt more pain after exercising and the more they used more physical activity to recover. \"As body mass index increased following exercise, inflammation was also present on the whole BMI, indicating an increased inflammation in women following exercise,\" says lead investigator Mary Lynn Palfrey of the University of Washington. \"By contrast, men experienced more pain and pain recovery after exercise because of their physical activity.\"\n\nPalfrey and her team studied 22 healthy volunteers who were also recruited following a previous study to assess exercise-induced inflammation. During their study, 20 men and women participated in 24 individual trials and then underwent a 24-week series of 2,500 minutes of physical activity.\n\nThe women who got the physical activity also experienced a significant decrease in their bone mass, and also had a significant increase in inflammation. The group who followed the treatment did not show any increases in their inflammatory markers and the same changes occurred in their bone thickness after the exercise treatment.\n\nPalfrey and her team believe that this is not a normal and healthy process because people can be healthy and active, but this is important to know. The most important part of this study involved a series of two subjects who spent a total of four weeks of their lives training.\n\nBefore they were tested, they performed a 1-month follow-up survey and then took the same measures for a 2-month follow-up survey. In the two surveys, each subject underwent 2,500 minutes of physical activity and underwent several physical tests. The subjects who had been followed for 3 months and had been doing no exercise reported their bone mass increase on days 1 to 4, and they also reported changes in inflammation after their physical activity had decreased.\n\nWhile it's not clear whether the same changes in inflammation observed for osteoarthritis were for those who were followed for 3 months or more, there's a clear link between the two to explain how people with the \"same\" inflammation respond to exercise. It turns out that people who have a higher body mass index (body mass index (BMI) is calculated by dividing BMI of an individual in a healthy population by the percentage of people in the healthy population) have a greater incidence of chronic inflammatory disease.\n\nI found that my bone mass was increased even though I had no physical activity.\n\nWhy?\n\nNot only did my inflammation correlate with my bone mass decline as well as with the degree of inflammation in my body, but this increased inflammation also increased inflammation on days 1 to 4, leading to increased inflammation on days 4 through 12. And then, finally, a 4-day period of inflammation would lead to a 4.5-million increase in my inflammation index.\n\nIt doesn't matter if these results are true or false. Over the course of this study, I've been able to determine that my inflammation increases with every week to 12, and that my physical activity levels have never been elevated in people with inflammation.\n\nI'm not saying I'm wrong to think that my body is good at being strong and resilient. A healthy body is a healthy and healthy body. I'm also not saying my body is good at managing inflammation, or that it should be treated as best it can be.

He pledged to stop spending on the EU budget until there was a solution to the crisis.\n\nMacron also announced he would step up his negotiations with the European Court of Justice, a position Macron described as a \"very bad mistake\" and a step which he said \"will mean I will continue spending almost half the sum this year for the European Court of Justice, to save up until my next election, in January.\"\n\nIn the face of growing public dissatisfaction with his government's handling of the crisis, the Fidesz newspaper published a report by the Flemish tabloid BFM Z, entitled \"Macron's 'Brexit' plans in 2015.\" The article, a collection of more than 500 pages, was written by former French Interior Minister Manuel Valls, who said he had warned in early 2015 not to pursue plans that would cut investment and to cut economic growth, and by September 2014 to launch what was described as a \"hard-hitting plan to prevent the crisis going away at any cost for his two years in office.\"\n\nMacron's budget request had been met with growing public criticism from public opposition parties. A party called by the populist Macron's campaign said on Saturday it hoped to persuade the opposition party to make a vote.\n\nThe Italian president also had harsh words for the European Council president, Herman Van Rompuy, and of U.S. President Donald Trump on Saturday night, calling on him to release transcripts of conversations with foreign officials and European Commission president Jean-Claude Juncker. Van Rompuy is facing investigations by investigators looking into his role in the Trump campaign's influence.", "length": 810, "ended": true}
{"id": 53, "text": "\nAs we noted before, the Supreme Court's recent confirmation of Neil Gorsuch to the Supreme Court makes President Trump the first person in American history to lose a federal election without ever winning reelection.\n\nPresident Trump's nomination of Jeff Sessions to replace Sessions as attorney general could lead to an exodus of Democratic voters \u2014 and that is why the Democrats have been looking at ways to turn around the GOP field.\n\nThe \"no-confidence\" rule put in place during the George W. Bush administration \u2014 which was supposed to ensure Donald J. Trump's candidacy \u2014 prevented anyone from ever winning a federal election without winning primaries and elections.\n\nThe rule, which had been in place for at least 15 years, was repealed by the Obama administration in 2009, and the Trump presidency \u2014 from which the rule was based in 2009 under John McCain to President George W. Bush \u2014 has been stuck in a constant state of continual rollback ever since.\n\nOn Monday, I wrote a post for Politico about the new rule. And while I wasn't quite sure what to make of it (it doesn't say \"stop voting for Republican senators\" \u2014 something that we've been talking about, and that may be true for awhile, but it's almost as if Trump has been a puppet of the rule for some time now), I wasn't really surprised that people have stopped voting for the Republican nominee.\n\nI don't usually like Republican candidates for senators, but I don't think there's a reason for those voters not to vote for a Democrat. The Democrats have tried repeatedly to roll back the rule of the rule, and they can now do it again, albeit only to a much greater extent and with lower turnout.\n\nTrump has been in office since 2008 because he was elected as a Republican president and President Barack Obama. This rule also took much of his Republican rivals \u2014 and the party apparatus from both parties \u2014 to court.\n\nHere are the ways some GOP Senators could go about rolling back the \"no confidence\" rule:\n\nSen. Susan Collins: \"You just are seeing what's happening in the GOP right now.\" Sen. Rand Paul: \"There are very few Republicans who want to do that.\"\n\nSen. Joe Manchin, the top Democrat on a committee that oversees the government, said that a Democratic confirmation of the Supreme Court would help her, though she didn't specify which of her own colleagues Trump would nominate to the court.\n\nRepublican Senators Lisa Murkowski, Susan Collins, Rob Portman, Rand Paul and Scott Brown, the committee chairman, all declined to confirm Gorsuch over concerns that the confirmation might result in the Senate Republicans having to accept the law in a minority of its members. Murkowski said, \"If I'm going to get rid of this and replace the law with something that works for us, as opposed to a filibuster, then that makes sense. But if I'm going to pick someone with a history of not getting confirmed, then I won't be able to do that over and over \u2014 and that's not being talked about here.\"\n\n\nSen. Bob Corker, who chairs the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, said that while it's his view that the Republican Party will have a better seat on the Supreme Court, \"if they nominate me (the next President's nominee) we will probably have to find out exactly what the numbers are about in terms of the numbers that the GOP wants us to change and what is their agenda or plan to move forward.\" Corker also said that \"you don't want to see a partisan takeover of the Senate.\"\n\nSen. Marco Rubio \u2014 who has not yet confirmed Gorsuch \u2014 said that he's still mulling the vote, but that he doesn't know where his position on Gorsuch is among those currently undecided. \"There's always a possibility that that's going to happen, even if I don't have a majority,\" he said. So far, \"there's only been the two votes that have indicated where, and that's with Gorsuch.\"\n\nIf they have a nominee with a history of not getting confirmed to the Supreme Court at all, however, this won't affect them completely.\n\nSenate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell has said that he will not allow Gorsuch to replace the Supreme Court's original law that he created in 2009, because he believes the law, and the fact that Gorsuch has served on it, \"is not really something that a majority of America cares about.\" But given that people still believe that the law was written before Scalia became one of the Supreme Court's most conservative \u2014 that it was written by Democrats who had a major problem with the law \u2014 McConnell and his Senate colleagues should respect this decision. So would Trump.\n\nThe only other Republican Senate to roll back the president's nominee is the one that will be confirmed by his Senate re-introduction this afternoon.\n\nAnd if Republican senators were thinking to block a President-elect's nomination for their seats on the U.S. Supreme Court, they probably wouldn't have done so.\n\nThis post has", "length": 1024, "ended": false}

It is the highest rate the U.S. has ever adopted.\n\nHawkes-Stewart, a former parliamentary aide who led the House panel to approve the policy, told Reuters the move \"demonstrates that this tax cut would go more toward paying for jobs and saving taxpayers money, rather than being a burden on small businesses that are struggling to make ends meet\". Hawkes-Stewart, who led the panel in 2010, said he did not understand what the tax cut was actually designed to do.\n\nThe Trump administration has claimed that cutting corporate taxes is an economic boon for the economy.

{"id": 56, "text": "\nThe first major U.S. defense acquisition took place during the early 1990s of the Pentagon at Arlington National Cemetery. As the site became a symbol of the Cold War-era Cold War era, the decision to spend $1.55 billion on research and development took place at the building's base.\n\nDefense Secretary Robert Gates said in 2001 that all of his national priorities were being met.\n\nAt the time, Gates was also considering how to spend the money.\n\nAfter reading the original plan, Obama and other Democrats were skeptical, and said he would give the Pentagon a budget of about $40 billion to build 10,000 U.S.- based military bases, with a budget that was lower than President George W. Bush's.\n\nThe final plan, a revised version was submitted in February 2007 to Congress and has been viewed with mixed feelings as Obama's proposal was rejected in court.\n\nIn its first public discussion, the Senate Armed Services Committee also voted for the initial plan, the last of six that it had for Congress in 2011 to consider.\n\nRepublicans opposed the plan, arguing that it would make America obsolete, especially since such a huge build up in defense spending would affect both U.S. and European military forces.\n\nBut the Senate Armed Services Committee also took issue with the budget on its approach to the Pentagon, noting that defense contractors, many of whom operate in Europe, are required to provide government services when they purchase a defense-related facility.\n\n\"For the very first time, in any of our 25-year history, a budget that has been drafted and executed before the world-changing military action we have just witnessed in Iraq,\" Senator John McCain, whose Republican-controlled Senate also opposed the planned U.S. military bases in Europe, said on Wednesday.\n\nSenate Armed Services Chairman Jim Inhofe criticized the proposal for \"repetitioning the disastrous wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, that were waged in the name of national defense.\"\n\nWith a budget that was more for Europe than for the United States, Obama and other Democrats were quick to point out that the budget that Obama would approve would not cost the United States $2.5 billion a year in defense services, the largest defense bill for more than a decade.\n\nWith that bill now in Congress, the administration could use the $2.75 billion of defense-related spending to make some reductions to the military after the defense cuts, but it would still take about a year and a half to pass the legislation.\n\nThe Pentagon did not respond to multiple requests for comment.\n\nIn recent weeks, Obama has been increasingly critical of those who opposed the spending bill, saying that the Pentagon's $500 billion of military-based spending is \"out of line with the standards set by the United States government and as such would be an abysmal waste of time. That's the wrong approach for the U.S.\"\n\nSome military leaders on Capitol Hill, meanwhile, are still questioning what role the Pentagon's defense budget will have on U.S. military operations in the Middle East. Obama wants to build the United States' military presence in Libya and Afghanistan, he said, while also saying there is a need to focus on improving security in the region.\n\nOne prominent member of Congress who backs the Pentagon's project to rebuild what's known as the International Center for Research and Evaluation, Rep. John Conyers, D-Mich., said Wednesday he would support the new report but said, \"When it comes to defense spending, there's a difference between 'Let's do what's right for our country' and 'Let's do what's right for national security.'\"", "length": 754, "ended": true}
